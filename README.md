## 🫧 Design Aesthetic: Claymorphism
**EcoYatra** features a custom-built **Claymorphism** UI. This design style provides a playful, "puffy," and tactile experience characterized by:
- **Soft Pastel Palettes**: Mint greens, lavender, and sky blues.
- **Inflated Geometries**: Puffy cards and buttons that appear to "pop" out of the screen.
- **Layered Depth**: Inner highlights and colored drop shadows for a realistic 3D-sculpted look.
- **Dynamic Micro-Animations**: Smooth, springy transitions powered by `react-native-reanimated`.
